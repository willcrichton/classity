========
Classity is a remote lecture service, intended for professors who want an interactive educational environment on the web. It enables educators to give lectures to anyone from anywhere (with an Internet connection). This was our submission for the Fall 2013 PennApp hackathon which received the awards for "Best Hack That Makes Life So Easy," "Best Cloud-Connected Hack," and "Best Use of TokBox API." Made by Will Crichton, Dillon Lareau, Patrick Xia, and Philip Garrison.
